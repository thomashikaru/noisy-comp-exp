provo	2	real	1	3	"I agree that California's ""three strikes and you're out"" law will be a financial disaster for taxpayers who care about education and other vital services.

Was the “Three Strikes Law” enacted in Arizona?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	4	"Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions.

provo	2	real	1	5	"Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.

"	Did Mrs. Darling notice the stars outside her window? 	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	6	"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.

"	Was Peter carrying a gun?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	7	"Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange.

"	Did Dorothy recognize where she was?	No	Yes

provo	2	real	1	9	"It was a forbidding challenge, and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive abilities, not to mention his self-confidence, that the admiralty agreed to fund him.

"	Did Winstanley plan to build a lighthouse?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	10	"A clergyman remarked to him, ""The Lord is on our side."" I am not at all concerned about that, replied Mr. Lincoln; ""for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right.

provo	2	real	1	12	"Some months later, Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a dash of ingenuity.

"	Did Mr. Larson withdraw his account in one dollar notes?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	13	"Bob Murphy, the Senior PGA Tour money leader with seven hundred thousand, says heat shouldn't be a factor.

Does Bob Murphy play golf?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	14	"With schools still closed, cars still buried and streets still blocked by the widespread weekend snowstorm, officials are asking people to pick up a shovel and help out.

The finding has direct implications for ecology and evolution."	Does the study find that all bites from the same animal are the same?	No	Yes

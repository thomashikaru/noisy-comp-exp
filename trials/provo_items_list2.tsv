provo	2	real	1	19	"Interestingly, the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave quite like science's best current models predict, so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full of surprises. Chemists cannot even predict with any certainty whether these materials will exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature."	Are the heavy isotopes easy to predict by Chemists?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	20	"Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it. It was a monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. "	Did Buck enjoy his monotonous life? 	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	21	"These days, neuroscience is beginning to catch up to musicians who practice mentally. Although the details are still somewhat elusive, the key to the success of mental imagery as a rehearsal technique is that most of the same neurological regions are invoked by mental practice as by real practice. "	Are most of the same neurological regions invoked by mental practice as by real practice? 	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	22	"Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees. "	Did the pirates hear the children's voices? 	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	23	"When a nucleus has all of its proton shells or neutron shells loaded to full capacity, the layers can align so well that each shell can spoon intimately with its attractive neighbors, forming a more compact sphere that fits well within the strong nuclear force's area of influence. "	Is the passage about astronomy?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	24	Hybrid vehicles have a halo that makes owners feel righteous and their neighbors feel guilty for not doing as much to save the planet. They also cost more and a new report from the very green Union of Concerned Scientists says buyers aren't always getting their money's worth.	Are hybrid vehicles always less expensive than conventional ones?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	25	"The girl's feet were then re-wrapped even tighter than before, causing her footprint to shrink further as the bones slowly fused into their new configuration. Occasionally girls' feet would fester, and blood poisoning from gangrene could be a cause for concern, but an estimated 90% survived the process."	Does the process of foot binding fuse the bones?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	26	"An early task will be to make sure the newfound microbes were not introduced while drilling through the ice into the lake, which involved a hot-water drilling technique designed to greatly reduce or eliminate any contamination that might come from other kerosene-based drilling technology, Christner said. "	Were the scientists drilling in the ocean?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	27	"Very similar, but even more striking, is the evidence from athletic training. As with rehearsing a piece on the piano, practicing a complex physical task in the mind alone is nearly as effective a learning strategy as actually physically doing it. But it doesn’t stop there. "	Is practicing a complex physical task in the mind an effective rehearsal strategy? 	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	28	"A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, it was decided that summer time should begin on the day following the third Saturday in April and close after the first Saturday in October."

Over the following years the island's population of four thousand or so was slowly eroded by Western disease and deportation by slave traders. "	Was the island’s population killed in a big storm?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	30	"Binge drinking may not necessarily kill or even damage brain cells, as commonly thought, a new animal study suggests. But it can block key receptors in the brain and trigger production of a steroid that interferes with brain functions critical to learning and memory. "	Can Binge Drinking block neuronal receptors?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	31	"When preparing to check out of their hotel room, some frequent travelers pile up their used bath towels on the bathroom floor, which would make them easy for housekeepers to spot.

Has Neptune completed its first orbit around the sun since being discovered by Earthlings? 	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	33	"When attacked, a skunk's natural inclination is to turn around, lick its tail and spray a noxious scent. That works when a skunk faces a natural predator in the wild, but it's not as helpful when faced with, let's say, an oncoming car."	Is this passage about porcupine scent?	No	Yes

provo	2	real	1	36	"Rich investors with no ties to farming, no dirt under their nails, are confident enough to wager big on a patch of earth betting that it's a smart investment because food will only get more expensive around the world."	Are rich investors investing in farming? 	Yes	No
